# K&R C Programming Exercises

This repository contains solutions and experiments based on exercises from the classic book:
**_The C Programming Language (2nd Edition)_ by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie**

## ðŸ“š Purpose
To build deep fluency in the C programming language by solving every exercise in the book, chapter by chapter. 
Each solution is written in standard ANSI C and focuses on clarity, correctness, and traceability. In addition to 
solving exercises from The C Programming Language, I will select representative problems from each chapter and 
apply a real-world software verification process to them. 

## ðŸ§­ Structure
The exercises are organized by chapter:
kr-c-exercises/
   - â”œâ”€â”€ chapter1_basics/
   - â”œâ”€â”€ chapter2_types_operators/ (Exercise_2.1 contains software verification process)
   - â”œâ”€â”€ chapter3_control_flow/
   - â”œâ”€â”€ chapter4_functions/
   - â”œâ”€â”€ chapter5_pointers_arrays/
   - â”œâ”€â”€ chapter6_structures/
   - â”œâ”€â”€ chapter7_input_output/
   - â”œâ”€â”€ chapter8_unix/

Each file is named like `ex1_1_hello_world.c` to reflect the chapter and exercise number.

## ðŸ›  How to Build
You can compile individual files using GCC:
gcc .\ex1.1hello_world.c -o .\ex1.1hello_world.exe
.\ex1.1hello_world.exe
